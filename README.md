# Griffin Pelletier Portfolio

## Description

Hi, welcome to my portfolio.  In this project I tried to accomplish things.  Firstly, this was perfect practise on how to start building a website from scratch.  Starting with HTML structure and adding CSS style.  Particularily, this was good practise for CSS, on how to make the elements on the page display how I want.  This is a good draft template for how I want to build my professional portfolio later in the bootcamp.

## Usage

When you go to my portfolio, the navigation links will take you to the section of the portfolio they are linked to. When you click the main image under the my work section it will bring you to the live page of my first module challenge.  When you click my github link under the Contact Me section you will be brought to my github.
